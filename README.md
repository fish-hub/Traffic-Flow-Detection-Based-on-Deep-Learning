# Traffic-Flow-Detection-Based-on-Deep-Learning
This project includes complete training and deployment of vehicle detection and traffic statistics model, using YOLOX and DeepSORT.


This project is the undergraduate graduation design code of fish-hub. The main work is traffic flow detection under the surveillance video.
The code consists of two parts: pyTorch training and QT deployment. Although code is not complete, but the basic functions can be achieved.
